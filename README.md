# Project title

K-nearest-neighbors

## Overview

This is an tutorial-like jupyter notebook that breaks down the k-nearest neighbors algorithm for classification. 
Data is used to predict whether a person have breast cancer or not. The algorithm is constructed from scratch. 
At the end it is shown how to proceed with the sci-kit learn library. 

## More details

The data used is kindly provided by UCI Machine Learning repository. It can be downloaded here:
* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29 

or here: 

* https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

The data provides several numerical features. Ten of them are used to feed the algorithm. The goal is to correctly predict if a patience have brest cancer or not.

Later on the code is presented a simple method to chose the best number of neighbors for the application. 

At the end of the notebook, the sci-kit learn library is used to solve the same problem. 

## How to see the output from the code

Just follow the notebook and you're good to go!
